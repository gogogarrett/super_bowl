**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add super_bowl to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:super_bowl, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure super_bowl is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:super_bowl]]
        end
